        title: "INTRODUCTION",
        body: "A teaching philosophy is like a guide that helps a teacher know what to do in the classroom. It shows what the teacher believes about learning and how they help students understand things better. As someone who teaches ICT (Information and Communication Technology), I believe that teaching is not just about giving information it’s about helping students think, explore, and use technology in ways that make their lives better.",
    },
    {
        title: "STATEMENT OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY",
        body: "I believe that students learn best when they are involved in the learning process. ICT is a subject that should be hands-on and connected to the real world. Instead of just telling students what to do, I give them chances to try things for themselves, work in groups, and ask questions.In my class, I make sure every student feels included and encouraged to take part. I don’t just talk while they listen. I let them use computers, create digital projects, and solve problems together. I see myself as a guide not someone who knows everything, but someone who helps them find answers and grow in confidence.",
    },
    {
        title: "VALIDITY OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY",
        body: "The way I teach is based on ideas from people like Vygotsky and Dewey. They believed that students learn better when they are active and when learning connects to their lives. I agree with that.So, I plan ICT lessons where students don’t just sit and write notes. They work on real tasks like using Microsoft Word to create a flyer, or learning how to stay safe online. When students do things themselves, they understand better and remember longer.",
    },
    {
        title: "APPLICATION OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY",
        body: "I used this teaching style during my teaching practice at Parkoso Senior High School, where I taught ICT. I tried to make lessons fun and practical. For example, when teaching about computer parts, I brought real parts to class and let students see and touch them.I also gave group tasks like designing posters about internet safety or creating PowerPoint slides about how technology helps in daily life. I let students explain their work in their own words. I helped those who found it hard and encouraged others to support their classmates too. The class became active and exciting.",
    },
    {
        title: "EFFECTIVENESS OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY",
        body: "I noticed that students were more interested in ICT when they were part of the learning. Some students who were quiet before started asking questions and sharing ideas. Others who didn’t like ICT at first began to enjoy it. They started improving in classwork and showed more confidence when using a computer.Many of them said they liked learning ICT because it was useful and fun. I was happy to see that my way of teaching helped students become more active and confident.",
    },
    {
        title: "CONCLUSION",
        body: "Teaching is not just about giving facts. It’s about helping students grow and believe in themselves. I’ve learned that when students feel respected and involved, they learn better.My teaching style may change as I learn more, but one thing will never change. I will always do my best to make learning meaningful and help each student discover what they can do, especially in the world of technology.",
